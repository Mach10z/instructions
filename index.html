  <h2>These pages are designed to help you provide the samples needed to test for Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea, Syphilis and HIV. It's very important that you take the time to follow the instructions in full. Generally, providing the samples only takes a few minutes, but it can sometimes take longer, especially for the blood test. If this is the case just relax and take your time.</h2>
